    "- `Use Case:`\n",
    "Storing a sequence of items where order matters, such as a list of tasks or a collection of names.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `Use Case:`\n",
    "Storing fixed collections of items, such as coordinates (latitude, longitude) or database records.\n",

    "Unordered collections of unique elements, meaning no duplicates are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Use Case:`\n",
    "Storing unique items, such as a collection of distinct values or removing duplicates from a list.\n",
